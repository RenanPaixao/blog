# Using old browser versions to test web apps

Sometimes we need to test our web apps in old browser versions, like when our application has some restriction about how
old a browser version is supported. So, I want to share how we can do this using chrome and mozilla browsers.

I'm using the linux version of the browsers, but the steps are similar in other OSs.

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center">
  <h2 style="margin: auto 0">Google Chrome</h2>
  <img style="margin: auto 0" alt="google logo" src="/posts/3.browsers/google-logo.svg" />
</div>

After some research, I found a [gist](https://gist.github.com/barbietunnie/a4f8475e0f0566597f7de74394ec7c8b){target=_blank}
with the links to download the old versions of chrome. So, we can download the desired version. 

I advise you to search for 
the version and also the OS ("win" for windows and "linux" for linux) that you want to download. The JSON is huge and 
has a lot of versions. We need only to use the download url of the version that we want.

After it, we don't need to install the browser, we just need to extract the files and run the chrome binary file. It helps, 
mainly when we need to test in multiple versions.

We just need to run the command below in the extracted folder:

```bash
./chrome
```

And then, the browser will open, and we can test our web app.
