# How to resolve Nuxt 3 flickering?

I was working on this blog when I noticed that the page had the css removed sometimes by the server side 
rendering.

<img alt="Flickering" style="margin: 0 auto" src="/posts/1.v-cloak/flickering.gif" width="500" height="300"/>


So, I found some solutions for this problem, the **v-cloak** directive and the **useAsyncData** composable.

## What is v-cloak?

It's a built-in directive used to hide templates un-compiled until it's ready.

So you can use it combined with css like this:

```html
<div v-cloak>
    ...
</div>
```

```css
[v-cloak] {
  display: none;
}
```

And then, the div will appear only when it's compiled.

It still not is a definitive solution, because when I get out of the blog to any other site and go back, 
the flicker still happens on the first load.

So with more some research, I found a solution that works for me.

I was using the `useHead` hook to add a favicon, and it was causing the flickering when running the page for the first 
time. I supposed that the page is rendered without the css, and then the css is added. 

So I just put the `useHead` inside the `useAsyncData` to the favicon be added and showed when the css is already added 
to the page. I do this because the `useAsyncData` is resolved in page transition, so putting the use head inside it will make
the favicon to be added in time to the page be rendered with the css.

Note that the `useAsyncData` requires a promise as a parameter. I used the `useHead` inside an async function, 
but the useHead return void, so the 'await' has no effect. 


```js
useAsyncData(async() => {
	await useHead({
		link: [
			{
				rel: 'icon',
				type: 'image/png',
				href: '/favicon.png'
			}
		]
	})
})
```

Now, the problem not will happen anymore.
