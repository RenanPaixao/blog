# How To Setup Lefthook to handle git hooks

## First of all, why Lefthook?

I will point some reasons to you choose lefthook when you need to decide a git hooks manager.

### 1. Configuration

Lefthook is very straightforward and it has a smooth setup, that can be worthy if you want to test if it is what you are looking for. We need a yaml file only, with a bunch of possibilities like docker support, flexible list of files (not needing for staged-commits add) and glob/regexp filters.

### 2. Velocity

As Lefhook is written in go, we can run commands in parallel, what grant for us a faster execution, what is not possible in some others git hooks managers.

### 3. Environment agnostic

Lefthook is a go binary with wrappers to other languages. So, it give you the possibility to share your config with teams using different programming languages, from front end to back end for instance.

I hope that you are convinced already. If not, take a look how simple is the setup.
