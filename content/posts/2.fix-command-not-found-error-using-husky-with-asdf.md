# How to fix command not found error using husky with asdf

---

I was working on a project that uses husky to run some scripts before commit, and I was using asdf to manage my node
versions. I was getting this error when I tried to commit:

```bash
 /bin/sh: yarn: command not found
```

I found a solution that worked for me. I added my `$PATH` content path to the `~/.huskyrc` file.

You can get the **$PATH** content, I just ran `echo $PATH` in your terminal.

So, it will be something like this:

```bash
## ~/.huskyrc
export PATH=">>$PATH CONTENT HERE<<"
```

And it worked. I hope it helps you too.
