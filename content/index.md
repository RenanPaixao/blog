# Renan Paixão

Hi, I'm Renan Paixão, a Software Developer in love with **Frontend** and everything about it, mainly about **Vue js**
and his universe. 

Here you will find a little more about what I'm studying in my free time (although I don't have much of it due 
university and the job) and other things that I find interesting.

You can find some of my projects [here](/projects) and some of my posts [here](/posts).
