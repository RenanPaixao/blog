# Renan Paixão

Hi, I'm Renan Paixão, a Software Developer that loves work with **Frontend** and QA, mainly the **Vue js** ecosystem and **Cypress**.

Here you will find some posts about things that I have struggled with in the past. The idea is post in my free time (although I don't have much of it due
university and the job), and maybe about other things that I think interesting.

You can find some of my projects [here](/projects) and some of my posts [here](/posts).
